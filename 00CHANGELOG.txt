Changes Between version 2.0 and version 2.1
-------------------------------------------

Minor release to fix one omission:
Data/corpus-resources/maptask-corpus.xml now includes path deviance
scores for all dialogues. Metadata file Data/maptask.xml altered to
declare the path deviance attribute.

Version 2.1 built by JAK 8.2.2011
